Batch of completions.

This includes:
    renderMethod where you learn that you can code before the return.

    renderIfElse shows you that can use conditions to render a component based on need.

    updateLifecycle introduces methods that are called when something is about to be updated, or after it has been updated.
    componentWillUpdate() --- componentDidUpdate() --- componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)

    shouldCompenentUpdate can be called to make sure the changes being made should be updated with shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)

    conciseCondition allows you to add if/else statements in a shorthand inline way { condition && <p>I show up</p>}

    ternary uses a ternary if/else statement to render buttons inside the render function --- not a fan.

    renderCondition shows you how to use a ternary to send versions of the component based on props.
